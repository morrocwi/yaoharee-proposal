### ðŸ§  Positioning with Respect to Related Work

This monograph (L0â€“L4), rooted in the algebraic seed equation \( A\varepsilon = \delta \), advances beyond current approaches to emergent mass, quantum coherence, and informational gravity by offering a **strictly local, axiom-free derivation** of core physical phenomena. Unlike contemporary modelsâ€”such as the *Tanfarid Quantum Thermodynamic Universe (TQTU)* [Chowdhury, 2025], *Quantum Information Spacetime Theory (QIST)* [Lin, 2025], and the *Causality Lock framework* [Sinclair, 2025]â€”which rely on assumed topologies, field constructions, or phenomenological heuristics, the UoI framework builds **all physical emergence from symbolic algebra alone**, with no imposed metric or external coherence field.

This work introduces a *post-field theoretical paradigm* that unifies unit-invariance, emergent causality, and mass-generation within a single logical structure, eliminating the need for multi-model architectures. It establishes coherence not as a field effect but as an algebraic necessity, encoded through symbolic consistency across reference chains. In this sense, it **supersedes prior models by reducing the ontology of physics to its irreducible computational and information-theoretic substrate**.

This document is best viewed as both a mathematical monograph and a systems-level epistemic compression of modern theoretical physics, enabling fully traceable derivations without dependence on empirical assumptions.



## Framework Overview

[cite_start]The core of this framework is a local-only, K-free (unit-invariant) model based on a single anchor frequency $\Omega_0$[cite: 7].

* [cite_start]**Seed Algebra:** $A\varepsilon=\delta$ [cite: 31]
* [cite_start]**Residual Dynamics:** $\dot{\varepsilon}=-\Lambda A^{\!\top}W(A\varepsilon-\delta)$ [cite: 32]
* **Lyapunov Energy:** $V=\tfrac12(A\varepsilon-\delta)^{\!\top}W(A\varepsilon-\delta)$
* [cite_start]**Field Emergence:** Derivation of the Telegraph/URE field $\Psi$ [cite: 33]

## Document Structure (L0â€“L7)

This repository maps the entire K-free series, structured as follows:

* [cite_start]**L0: Master Paper:** Introduces the core symbolic flow, governance rules, and energy budget[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**L1: Scale-Lock Mechanism:** Proves phase/scale-lock as a necessary consequence of Lyapunov dissipation[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**L2: Emergent Field Dynamics & MVS:** Mathematical derivation of the field, including Minimal Viable Simulations (MVS) TP1/TP2[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**L3: Lyapunov Stability:** Technical proof of global stability for the residual field[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**L4: $\Omega_0$ Normalization Standard:** The "Rosetta Stone" for unit-free physics, defining the hat-frame and invariance[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**L5: Falsifiable Predictions:** Cross-domain scaling law hypotheses ($g \propto f^{\beta}$)[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**L6: Experimental Protocol (E1):** Validation design for $\Psi$-field dynamics in EEG data[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**L7: Measurement Framework:** Defines the "Xlock" coherence gate and criteria for valid measurements[cite: 17].

## Artifacts & Reproducibility
